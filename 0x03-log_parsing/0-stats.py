Metrics Calculator

This script reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.

Input format:<IP Address>[<date>] <status code><file size>
(if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)

After every 10 lines,keyboard interrupt print statistics since the beginning
Total file size: File size: <total size>
where <total size>is the sum of all previous<file size>(see input format above)

Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, and 500
status code doesnâ€™t appear, not an integer, it doesn't print anything.
format: <status code>: <number>
status codes should be printed in ascending order

Warning: In this sample, you will have random values.
